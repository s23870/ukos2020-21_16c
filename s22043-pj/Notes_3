My dear diary, today I do some exercises about processes and streams.

Warm up task:
TASK: Go to your home directory and issue this command:
ls -a
*There was 17 directories and 19 files

See how many files have been printed. Now execute that command:
ls -a | grep D
*There was 3 directories

ls -a | grep D > ListaPlikówZLiterkąD.txt
* There has been created new txt file , when I write cat command it shows folders with the letter d
*> Means to redirect standard output to a file

Exercise 1

The "ps" command is used to show a list of processes. See what happens if we type it in the terminal:

    ps -  Displayed basic process data.
    ps -a - Displayed basic process data without process about bash,
    ps x -  Displayed data about more processes.
    ps aux - Displayed detailed data about processes.

*When there is ? mark it mean's that process has no controlling terminal.
A process with no controlling terminal is a daemon.

Bash and root processes:
*I used command ps -ef | grep bash/root

Exercise 2

1. I opened TEXT Editor,
2. I saw his PID by using command: ps aux | grep gedit and it was: 1336.
3. I closed it by using command: kill 1336.
4. I opened seberal firefox windows and closed them by using command: killall firefox.
5. As a user I can only kill my own processes, a root I can kill all of them.

Exercise 3

 1. We run command "cat" with no parameters.
*Nothing happens, process open etc...

 2. Press CTRL + C and see what happens:
*CTRL + C the process is closes.

    Issue command "cat > wynik1.txt"
    Write text "witaj" without using Enter key.
    Press Ctrl+C
    See what is in "wynik1.txt " file.
    
    NOTHING - FILE IS EMPTY

    Issue command "cat > wynik2.txt"
    Write text "witaj" without using Enter key.
    Press Ctrl+D (maybe you must press 2 times)
    See what is in "wynik1.txt " file.

    There is message "witaj" inside this file.

Exercise 4

*I opened gimp'a.
*I press CTRL + Z.
*In GIMP I can't do anything.

Program was stopped but still worked in the background.

To restart GIMP you have to enter the command bg. (fg -  open program in the first plan).

gimp & -  you can starts program in the background from began.

jobs - showing all programs in the background.

For today that's it. See you in next month!!!
